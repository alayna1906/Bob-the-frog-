Once there was a frog.
He was not a normal frog 
He had a tongue as long and as wide as a boat 
He helped all the animals cross the river. 
By letting them walk on his tongue. 

One day young animals of the Animal School came to his river for a field trip.
They sat on one end of the river and observed Bob the frog. 
Ms. Petunia, their teacher, explained to the students that only one in a million frogs are born with such a tongue. 
The students were amazed. 

After Ms. Petunia finished explaining. 
Peppa Pig asked if they could actually cross the river using his tongue.

Ms. Petunia agreed to let the young animals try for themselves. 
She lined each of them up. 
Then she told her assistant teacher Mr. Giffy, the giraffe, to cross the river and wait on the other end for the other children to cross, so that there is an an adult animal on each end.
Mr. Giffy did as he was told. 

One by one each animal student crossed the river using Bob the frog's tongue. 
At last only Ms. Petunia was left to cross. 
As she started crossing, Bob the frog, started to roll his tongue back into his mouth and didn't notice Ms. Petunia.
